# Text Adventure
Create a text based adventure game! For this assignment you'll be creating 
a text based adventure game ala Zork. This game should have at least two rooms
that the player can move between. One item that the player can interact with and 
one monster for the player to defeat. Your webpage should have a command input
and a button or a form submission to do something based on the command. No need
to try and persist the data. Make sure to create each of your different commands 
or actions as functions on your controller.
